# Memory Vector Store
Sample of implementing a simple in-memory vector store

This repository:
The repository contains three main projects: 
- Memory Vector Store project, which focuses on storing vectors in memory;
- Chunk Creator project, which extracts vectors from PDF files;
- Sample Search project, which demonstrates how to perform similarity searches using the stored vectors. Each project has its own set of code and resources, allowing you to explore and understand the implementation details.

 This code is based on the blog post titled "Vector Search with C#: A Practical Approach for Small Datasets." [https://crispycode.net/vector-search-with-c-a-practical-approach-for-small-datasets/]
